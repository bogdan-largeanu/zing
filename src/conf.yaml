      This entire block of text will be the value of the 'literal_block' key,
      with line breaks being preserved.

      The literal continues until de-dented, and the leading indentation is
      stripped.

          Any lines that are 'more-indented' keep the rest of their indentation -
          these lines will indented by 4 spaces.
